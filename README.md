# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Description
This application will allow a user to search a city in the world using only city name and will give the user the current weather and a 5 day forecast. This application uses HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the 
server-side API called OpenWeatherMap. This application will also track the users previous searches on the page. In addition, if the user refreshed the page the data for their last city that was 
searched will be displayed alongside its current and future weather conditions.
